All documents are in this repository's main branch:

1. [**AI Architecture for Material Sorting and Volumization**](AI_Architecture_for_Material_Sorting_and_Volumization.docx)  
   - Technical details of our EfficientNetB0 + U-Net system  
   - Real-time waste classification and volume estimation
   - For my work, see this document. It has details about how I went ahead with the Computer Vision powered material sorting system using EfficientNetB0 and U-Net for real-time classification/segmentation of construction waste on a conveyor belt, with volume estimation via depth sensor fusion.

2. [**Circathon Challenge Overview**](CIRCATHON_CHALLENGE_-_Circular_Construction_Center.pdf)  
   - Competition background and objectives
   - Overview of the Circathon

3. [**KROG Final Proposal**](KROG_Final_Proposal.pdf)  
   - Our complete solution: conveyor system, DCWP software, and marketplace
   - It features a conveyor belt with RGB cameras for real-time waste classification (using CNNs), a waste management software (DCWP), and an online marketplace (KROG Marketplace¬Æ) to connect recycled materials with reuse applications.

4. [**Circathon Presentation**](CIRCATHON_2025_PPT.pptx)  
   - Our award-winning pitch deck

5. [**Project Screenshots**](/Screenshots_and_Glimpses_of_the_Circathon)  
   - Demo images and competition photos
   - Here, you can see the screenshots of the final presentation, the comments we got and the winner announcements, and also glimpses of how we planned the entire project
